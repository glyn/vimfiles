# The Vim Configuration.

If you're trying to use this config checkout this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/luan/vimfiles/wiki/Luan's-Vim-Cheat-Sheet).

## Installation

1. `git clone http://github.com/luan/vimfiles.git` in your home folder.
2. `mv vimfiles .vim`
3. `cd .vim`
4. `./install` Runs everything you need to get started
5. Enjoy enhanced productivity, increased levitation, reduced watermelon-related accidents, and startling sex appeal.

## Install Script

The directory contains a bash script named `install`. `install` will create your local override files (`.vimrc.loca.before` and `.vimrc.local`), symlink `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`.
It will also install `golang`'s tools if you have golang on your `$PATH`.

## Notes

Be sure to always edit the vimrc using `,vi`, which opens the vimrc in the .vim folder. Vim has a nasty habit of overriding symlinks.

```
" will save automatically when exiting the buffer
" 0 or 1, defaults 0
let g:autosave = 1
```
